#' Edge Percentage Frequency
#'
#' This function allows you to calculate the percent of pitches thrown to different edges of the strike zone for a pitch by pitch data set that has been coded using the edge_code() function.
#' @param df A data frame of pitch by pitch data that has been coded using the edge_code() function.
#' @param group Character string indicating what column to group the frequency by. For example, "pitcher" or "batter". Defaults to NULL, which calculates the frequencies across the entire data set.
#' @keywords MLB, sabermetrics, PITCHf/x
#' @export
#' @examples \dontrun{edge_code(df, group = "pitcher")}
